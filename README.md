## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deep1305/YT_Video_Website_URL_Summarization.git
    cd YT_Video_Website_URL_Summarization
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file. If not, you can create one from your `pyproject.toml` or list the core dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit langchain-groq langchain-community youtube-transcript-api validators unstructured[all-docs]
    ```
    *(Note: `unstructured[all-docs]` installs dependencies for various file types. You might only need the base `unstructured` if web URLs are your only non-YouTube source.)*

4.  **Get a Groq API Key:**
    *   Sign up at [GroqCloud](https://console.groq.com/keys).
    *   Create an API key and copy it.
